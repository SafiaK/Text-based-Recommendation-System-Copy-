In last few years immense amount of work has been done on recommendation systems(RS). Big companies like YouTube\cite{AddRef},Google\cite{AddRef} and Amazon\cite{amazon} are continuously improving their recommendation systems by employing the latest techniques. While text share a major portion of data available over internet, researchers are exploiting it to enhance the quality of RS.Recommendation systems,built for news or for academic journals are usually entirely text-based\cite{AddRef} and referred as Content based systems, whereas product suggestion system such as amazon and Netflix utilize items attributes\cite{AddRef} and users reviews\cite{AddRef}for this particular purpose.Here we will discuss the different approaches that make use of text; in one form or other, to make recommendation.
\subsection{Profile Similarity Approach}
In this particular setting the user profile and item profile is first generated using different feature selection techniques as described above. These profiles are then compared to find the best suited recommendations. There are a multiple ways of this comparison, though the cosine similarity is the most famous one. Here is a brief detail about all such similarity measures used in literature.
